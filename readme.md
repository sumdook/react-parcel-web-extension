# react-parcel-web-extension
This is a boilerplate for building cross browser chrome extensions with React and Parcel. 

- Templated popup and options UI.
- Boilerplate for injecting react app into DOM with content script.
- Configured with HMR in development environment.

> Note: Since parcel 2 is still in beta, the parcel packages used are unstable at the time of writing this. 
> I've locked the template with the version of parcel packages that worked for me for the time being.

## Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`
This starts the extension in development mode. Builds the extension in `dist` folder which can be loaded into chrome/firefox/edge.
This is not optimized for production and is configured for development with sourcemaps and HMR enabled.

#### `yarn build`
Builds the extension for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
